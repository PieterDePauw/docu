## The Importance of Regular Veterinary Visits

Regular veterinary visits are crucial for maintaining your dog's health. These visits often include vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and general health check-ups.

### Initial Puppy Visits

For puppies, a series of initial visits are essential for vaccinations and basic health screenings. These visits are also an opportunity for you to ask questions about feeding, training, and general care.

### Adult Dog Visits

For adult dogs, annual check-ups are generally sufficient unless there are ongoing health issues that require more frequent visits.

### Senior Dog Visits

As dogs age, they may require more frequent veterinary care. Bi-annual visits are often recommended for senior dogs.

## Common Health Issues

Dogs can suffer from a range of health issues, some of which are common across all breeds.
