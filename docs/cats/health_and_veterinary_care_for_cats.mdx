# Health and Veterinary Care for Cats

Regular veterinary care is essential for maintaining your cat's health. Routine check-ups can help detect potential issues early, ensuring your feline friend leads a long, healthy life.

## Routine Check-ups

Annual or bi-annual visits to the vet are crucial. These check-ups include:

- Physical examination
- Blood tests
- Parasite screenings
- Dental check-ups

## Vaccinations

Vaccinations protect cats from various diseases:

- **Core vaccines:** Feline panleukopenia, feline calicivirus, feline rhinotracheitis, and rabies.
- **Non-core vaccines:** Depending on lifestyle and location, vaccines for feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, and others might be recommended.

## Spaying and Neutering

Spaying (for females) and neutering (for males) prevent unwanted litters and can also prevent certain health issues and behaviors.

## Dental Health

Dental diseases can lead to more severe health issues. Regular dental check-ups, brushing, and dental diets can help maintain oral health.

## Parasite Prevention

Protect your cat from parasites like fleas, ticks, and worms. Regular treatments and check-ups can help keep these pests at bay.

## Recognizing Signs of Illness

Always be vigilant for signs of illness:

- Changes in appetite or water intake
- Lethargy or changes in behavior
- Vomiting, diarrhea, or other digestive issues
- Coughing, sneezing, or other respiratory signs

If you notice any concerning signs, consult your vet immediately. Timely intervention can make a significant difference in outcomes.
